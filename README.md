# Filter-out-voice-noise-with-Wiener-filter
Eliminate noise by passing the voice signal with noise through a wiener filter and calculate the SSNR of the voice signal, using SSNRI to evaluate the quality of the speech.  
## Clean speech mixed with noise
Use the audio_SNR.m program to mix clean speech into noise speech with a specified noise ratio.  
The equation of the SNR is as the following figure:
